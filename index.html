          I'll be sure to note that in my log. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Your shields were failing, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Your head is not an artifact! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.

            The unexpected is our normal routine. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?

I'll be sure to note that in my log. and attack the Romulans. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Besides, you look good in a dress.
